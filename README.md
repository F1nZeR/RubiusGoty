# Next-gen team-building software

Things still missing from this product:

 - Device - we need to know what the product will be run on.
 - Intro sequence - anything before start of the game, including what we say and how we make people buy it.
 - Map / game type - decide what players will do and where.
 - Game end - victory condition, high score, or whatever happens there.
 - HUD code - ways to show icons, text, and all that stuff on top of the game.
 - Network control code - way for people to connect to game's control pages and two-way communicate.
 - Collision detection - ideally for a rectangular tank and separately for barrel. At least for a circular tank in vacuum.
 - Driving physics - inertia, sliding, better particles, terrain types.
 - Per-track controls - switch from rotate/throttle scheme to throttle/throttle.
 - Powerups - type design, spawn code, pickup code.
 - Sounds - lots of them!
  - Shots, blasts, engine roar, metal scratching metal, metal scratching rock, dirt smacking, tracks screeching, and various blip, blups and jingles for powerups.
 - SPRITES. The game should contain lots of graphonium, and ideally original.
  - Fonts, frames, powerup icons, tank components, particles, shells, blasts, map tiles, destructibles, ravaged terrain.
 - Proper music - cool, retro-y, and ideally royalty-free.
