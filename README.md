# Next-gen team-building software

Things still missing from this product:

 - ~~Device - we'll take any laptop and a router from work~~.
  - Setup router's DNS.
 - Intro sequence - anything before start of the game, including what we say and how we make people buy it.
 - ~~Game type - decide what players will do and where~~.
  - Map - rebuild to more final state.
 - Game end - victory condition, high score, or whatever happens there.
 - HUD code - ways to show icons, text, and all that stuff on top of the game.
 - ~~Network control code - way for people to connect to game's control pages and two-way communicate~~.
  - ~~Disconnect leaves input on~~.
 - ~~Collision detection - ideally for a rectangular tank and separately for barrel. At least for a circular tank in vacuum~~.
 - ~~Driving physics - inertia, sliding, better particles, terrain types~~.
  - Drifting bug - applying reverse torque makes tank slide more than just letting go.
 - ~~Per-track controls - switch from rotate/throttle scheme to throttle/throttle~~ - we won't use that.
 - Powerups - type design, spawn code, pickup code.
 - Sounds - lots of them!
  - ~~Shots~~, ~~blasts~~, ~~engine roar~~, metal scratching metal, metal scratching rock, dirt smacking, tracks screeching, and various blip, blups and jingles for powerups.
 - SPRITES. The game should contain lots of graphonium, and ideally original.
  - Fonts, frames, powerup icons, ~~tank components~~, particles, shells, ~~blasts~~, map tiles, destructibles, ravaged terrain.
 - Proper music - cool, retro-y, and ideally royalty-free.
